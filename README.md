## Getting Started

To get started you must first install the package from composer.

```bash
composer require danrovito/pokephp
```

After composer installs the required package you can call the class by setting the following:

```php
$api = new PokePHP\PokeApi;
```

This will give you the instance of the class to call the API functions.  Below you will see examples for each endpoint.  I utilize the `$api` variable we created above to call each function.

## Usage

You can search the data in the `$api` instance by calling the `search` method and passing a `filter` with an optional value, just as you can still limit the results with the `limit` method. To retrieve the data you must call the request method, which will return a json.

```php
$response = $api->search(Filter::POKEMON_COLOR, 'red')->limit(5)->request();

```

### Pagination
You can add `offset()` for the next source list
```php
$response = $api->search(Filter::POKEMON_COLOR, 'red')->limit(5)->offset(20)->request();

```
Or you can use the `page()` function for simplicity.
```php
$response = $api->search(Filter::POKEMON_COLOR, 'red')->limit(5)->page(2)->request();

```
Or both, but the `offset()` function will overwrite the result of the `page()` function 
```php
$response = $api->search(Filter::POKEMON_COLOR, 'red')->limit(5)->page(2)->offset(20)->request();

```
Is same with
```php
$response = $api->search(Filter::POKEMON_COLOR, 'red')->limit(5)->offset(20)->page(2)->request();

```

### Type Response
Basically, the 'request' function just returns a raw response from PokeAPI. If you use `var_dump()` it will indicate that the type is `string`.

But now you can choose your preferred response type

Default type / string:
```php
$response = $api->search(Filter::POKEMON_COLOR, 'red')->limit(5)->request();

```

Array type:
```php
$response = $api->search(Filter::POKEMON_COLOR, 'red')->limit(5)->request(PokeApi::ARRAY);

```

Object type:
```php
$response = $api->search(Filter::POKEMON_COLOR, 'red')->limit(5)->request(PokeApi::OBJECT);

```
